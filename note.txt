-------------------------------------------------------------------
In kubernetes the smallest unit is Pod in which we have a container or containers depending upon
the condition if two containers are tightly coupled and need to be in the same pod
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Kubernetes has three type of services
1) ClusterIp (accessable within node)
2) NodePort (accessable from anynode ip and alloccated node of NodePort)
3) LoadBalancer (Provided by cloud provider)
-------------------------------------------------------------------





-------------------------------------------------------------------
 By default, kubernetes assumes that a POD or a container
 within a POD requires .5 CPU & 256 Mebibyte of memory. we can change

resources:
    requests:
        memory: "128Mi"
        cpu: "500m"

BY default Kubernetes sets a limit of 1vCPU to containers. So if you do not specify
explicitly, a container will be limited to consume only 1 vCPU from the Node limit of 512 Mebibyte on
containers..
  limits:
    memory: "2Gi"
    cpu: "1000m"

So what happens when a pod tries to exceed resources beyond its specified limit. In
case of the CPU, kubernetes throttles the CPU so that it does not go beyond the
specified limit. A container cannot use more CPU resources than its limit. However,
this is not the case with memory. A container CAN use more memory resources that
its limit. So if a pod tries to consume more memory than its limit constantly, the POD
will be terminated.

TAIN POD
kubectl taint nodes node-name key=value:taint-effect
                                       NoShedule|PreferNoShedule:NoExecute
e.g 
kubectl taint nodes node-1 app=blue:NoExecute

TOLERATE POD

in alighn with containers
               tolerations:
                 - key : "app"
                   operator: "Equal"
                   value: blue 
                   effect: NoExecute


k describe node kubemaster | grep Taint


To install only mysql (client) you should execute
yum install mysql
To install mysql client and mysql server:
yum install mysql mysql-server

mysql -u username -h mysql_server_ip -p
